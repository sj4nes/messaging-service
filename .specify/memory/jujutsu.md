Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version

Global Options:
  -R, --repository <REPOSITORY>
          Path to repository to operate on
          
          By default, Jujutsu searches for the closest .jj/ directory in an ancestor of the current working
          directory.

      --ignore-working-copy
          Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it
          
          By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The working copy is also
          updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to
          avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use
          `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another
          process that commits the working copy.
          
          Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies `--ignore-working-copy`.

      --ignore-immutable
          Allow rewriting immutable commits
          
          By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits. This option
          disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.
          
          This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or the `immutable`
          template keyword.

      --at-operation <AT_OPERATION>
          Operation to load the repo at
          
          Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the
          merge of the divergent operations if any.
          
          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example
          `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had
          just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will
          never be merged.
          
          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.
          
          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if
          `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.
          
          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is
          equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to
          do that, but it is possible.
          
          [aliases: --at-op]

      --debug
          Enable debug logging

      --color <WHEN>
          When to colorize output
          
          [possible values: always, never, debug, auto]

      --quiet
          Silence non-primary command output
          
          For example, `jj file list` will still list files, but it won't tell you if the working copy was
          snapshotted or if descendants were rebased.
          
          Warnings and errors will still be printed.

      --no-pager
          Disable the pager

      --config <NAME=VALUE>
          Additional configuration options (can be repeated)
          
          The name should be specified as TOML dotted keys. The value should be specified as a TOML expression. If
          string value isn't enclosed by any TOML constructs (such as array notation), quotes can be omitted.

      --config-file <PATH>
          Additional configuration files (can be repeated)
